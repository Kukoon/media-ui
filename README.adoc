Media-UI is the frontend of our organisation’s streaming and media platform. It is built with https://vuejs.org/[vue 2] & link:vuetifyjs.com/[vuetify]. The underlying API is written in https://go.dev/[Go] and lives at https://gitlab.com/kukoon/mediathek/media-server[gitlab.com/kukoon/mediathek/media-server]. To generate webp previews we use our experimental https://github.com/Kukoon/thumbnailer[thumbnailer].
